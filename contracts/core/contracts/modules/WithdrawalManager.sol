/**
 * @title WithdrawalManager
 * @notice Handles all withdrawal logic and queries for the Deramp system.
 *
 * @dev Responsibilities:
 * - Manages user/commercial withdrawals and withdrawal history.
 * - Handles withdrawal limits, types, and statistics.
 * - Exposes queries for withdrawal records and analytics.
 *
 * Upgradeability:
 * - All withdrawal logic should reside here for easy upgrades.
 * - Only the proxy or authorized modules should interact with this contract.
 *
 * Security:
 * - Enforces access control for withdrawals.
 * - Only the proxy or authorized users can initiate withdrawals.
 *
 * Recommendations:
 * - Document all withdrawal types and their intended use.
 * - Keep withdrawal logic isolated from unrelated business logic.
