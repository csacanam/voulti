## Overview

The Deramp Smart Contract System is a modular, proxy-based architecture designed for secure and efficient payment processing, invoice management, and treasury operations. The system follows a microservices-like approach where each module handles specific business logic while maintaining data consistency through a centralized storage layer.

### Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Specialized modules for different business functions
- **Proxy Pattern**: Single entry point with delegated execution
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions system
- **Upgradeable Architecture**: Modules can be updated without data loss
- **Event-Driven**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring

## Architectural Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns

Each module has a single, well-defined responsibility:

- **AccessManager**: Authentication and authorization
- **InvoiceManager**: Invoice lifecycle management
- **PaymentProcessor**: Payment processing and refunds
- **WithdrawalManager**: Balance withdrawals and analytics
- **TreasuryManager**: Treasury operations and fee distribution

### 2. Single Point of Entry

All external interactions go through the DerampProxy, which acts as a facade and request router.

### 3. Centralized Data Management

All persistent data is stored in DerampStorage, ensuring consistency and enabling atomic operations.

### 4. Interface Segregation

Each module implements specific interfaces, enabling loose coupling and testability.

### 5. Fail-Safe Defaults

The system defaults to restrictive permissions and requires explicit authorization for sensitive operations.

## System Components

## Data Flow

### Payment Processing Flow

1. **User Initiates Payment**

   - User calls `payInvoice()` on DerampProxy
   - Proxy validates basic parameters

2. **Delegation to PaymentProcessor**

   - Proxy encodes function call using `abi.encodeWithSignature`
   - Proxy performs `delegatecall` to PaymentProcessor
   - PaymentProcessor executes in Proxy's context

3. **Invoice Validation**

   - PaymentProcessor retrieves invoice from DerampStorage
   - Validates invoice status (must be PENDING)
   - Validates payment option and amount

4. **Token Transfer**

   - PaymentProcessor calls ERC20 `transferFrom()`
   - Tokens transferred from user to contract

5. **Fee Calculation and Distribution**

   - Calculate service fee based on configured percentage
   - Calculate commerce amount (payment - service fee)

6. **State Updates**

   - Update invoice status to PAID
   - Add commerce amount to commerce balance
   - Add service fee to system fee balance

7. **Event Emission**
   - Emit `InvoicePaid` event for monitoring

### Withdrawal Flow

1. **Commerce Initiates Withdrawal**

   - Commerce calls withdrawal function on DerampProxy
   - Proxy delegates to WithdrawalManager

2. **Authorization Check**

   - WithdrawalManager verifies commerce is whitelisted
   - Checks commerce has sufficient balance

3. **Balance Updates**

   - Subtract withdrawn amount from commerce balance
   - Update withdrawal statistics

4. **Token Transfer**
   - Transfer tokens from contract to commerce wallet
   - Emit withdrawal event

## Security Model

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

The system implements a hierarchical role-based access control system:

#### Role Hierarchy

```mermaid

    subgraph "Role Hierarchy"
        Admin[DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE<br/>System Administrator]

        subgraph "Specialized Roles"
            TokenMgr[TOKEN_MANAGER_ROLE<br/>Token Management]
            OnboardMgr[ONBOARDING_ROLE<br/>Commerce Management]
            TreasuryRole[TREASURY_MANAGER_ROLE<br/>Treasury Operations]
        end

        subgraph "Entity Roles"
            Commerce[Whitelisted Commerce]
            User[Regular User]
        end
    end

    Admin -.->|can grant| OnboardMgr
    Admin -.->|can grant| TreasuryRole
    OnboardMgr -.->|can whitelist| Commerce
```

| Whitelisted Commerce  | ❌          | ❌            | ❌              | ❌              | ❌               | ✅\*           | ❌              |
| Regular User          | ❌          | ❌            | ❌              | ❌              | ✅\*\*           | ❌             | ❌              |

## Deployment Architecture

### Deployment Sequence

```mermaid

    participant Deployer as Contract Deployer
    participant Storage as DerampStorage
    participant AccessMgr as AccessManager
    participant Modules as Other Modules
    participant Proxy as DerampProxy

    Note over Deployer,Proxy: Deployment Process

    Deployer->>+Storage: deploy DerampStorage
    Storage-->>-Deployer: storage address

    AccessMgr->>Storage: register as authorized module
    AccessMgr-->>-Deployer: accessManager address

    Deployer->>+Modules: deploy other modules(storage, accessManager)
    Modules->>Storage: register as authorized modules
    Modules-->>-Deployer: module addresses

    Deployer->>+Proxy: deploy DerampProxy(storage, modules...)
    Proxy->>Storage: verify module registrations

    Deployer->>Proxy: grantRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin)
    Deployer->>Proxy: addTokenToWhitelist(USDC)
    Deployer->>Proxy: addCommerceToWhitelist(commerce1)
```

### Module Registration

Each module must be registered with DerampStorage to perform write operations:

```solidity
// During deployment
storage.setModule("AccessManager", accessManagerAddress);
storage.setModule("InvoiceManager", invoiceManagerAddress);
storage.setModule("PaymentProcessor", paymentProcessorAddress);
storage.setModule("WithdrawalManager", withdrawalManagerAddress);
storage.setModule("TreasuryManager", treasuryManagerAddress);
```

## Integration Patterns

### 1. Proxy Pattern Implementation

The system uses a transparent proxy pattern where:

- DerampProxy acts as the single entry point
- Business logic is delegated to specialized modules
- State is maintained in the proxy contract
- Modules can be upgraded without losing data

### 2. Interface Segregation

Each module implements specific interfaces:

- Enables loose coupling between components
- Facilitates testing and mocking
- Allows for module replacement
- Provides clear contracts for external integrations

### 3. Event-Driven Architecture

The system emits comprehensive events for:

- Invoice lifecycle changes
- Payment processing
- Balance modifications
- Role changes
- Administrative actions

### 4. Repository Pattern

DerampStorage acts as a repository:

- Centralizes all data access
- Provides consistent data access patterns
- Enables atomic operations
- Facilitates data migration and backup

## Best Practices and Recommendations

### 1. Deployment Best Practices

- Deploy modules in correct order (Storage → AccessManager → Other Modules → Proxy)
- Verify all module registrations before going live
- Set up proper role assignments during deployment
- Test all integrations in staging environment

### 2. Security Best Practices

- Use multi-signature wallets for admin roles
- Implement timelock for critical operations
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Monitor events for suspicious activities

### 3. Operational Best Practices

- Implement proper monitoring and alerting
- Maintain comprehensive documentation
- Regular backup of critical data
- Disaster recovery procedures

### 4. Development Best Practices

- Comprehensive unit and integration testing
- Code coverage above 90%
- Static analysis and linting
- Formal verification for critical functions

## Conclusion

The Deramp Smart Contract System represents a sophisticated, modular architecture that prioritizes security, maintainability, and scalability. The use of the proxy pattern with delegated execution, combined with role-based access control and comprehensive event logging, creates a robust foundation for payment processing and treasury management operations.

The system's modular design allows for easy upgrades and maintenance while preserving data integrity and user funds. The comprehensive security model, including multiple layers of access control and input validation, ensures that the system can operate safely in a production environment.

This architecture serves as a solid foundation for building complex DeFi applications while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to changing requirements and integrate with other blockchain systems.
